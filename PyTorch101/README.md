This repository describes in brief the concepts of neural networks and demonstrates the pytorch code for XOR gate.

Happy Learning!

## Let's get started!

Whether you’ve noticed it or not, Deep Learning (DL) plays an important part in all our lives. From the voice assistants and auto-correct services on your smartphone to the automation of large industries, deep learning is the underlying concept behind these meteoric rises in human progress. A major concept that we implement in deep learning is that of neural networks.

## What exactly are Neural Networks?
A neural network is a computing algorithm of an interconnected system of mathematical formulae used to make predictions by “training” the algorithm on data relevant to the prediction to be made. This is partly inspired by the way neurons are connected in biological brains. With the ability to make near life-like predictions of numerical, image and character data, given the appropriate amount of training, neural networks(NNs) have become integral to advancements in the field.
